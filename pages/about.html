      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>The NurtureHer team recognized that autistic women with PCOD and PCOS often face unique challenges in tracking cycles, symptoms, and mental health. Traditional health apps don’t always cater to sensory sensitivities or accessibility needs. We built NurtureHer to fill that gap — a safe, supportive, and intuitive platform that simplifies health tracking while promoting overall wellness.</p>
